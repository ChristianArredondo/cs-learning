# General Software Engineer Review

### SOLID Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle
A class should only have a single responsibility.

#### Open-closed Principle
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

#### Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

#### Interface Segregation Principle
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

#### Dependency Inversion Principle
One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.

# 1.1 - Basic Programming Model

- The term algorithm is used in computer science to describe a finite, deterministic, and effective problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program

## Basic Structure of a Java Program

- A java program (class) is either a library of static methods (functions) or a data type definition
- Five components:
  - _primitive data types_
    - integer, real number, boolean
    - includes set of possible values and operations on those values
  - _statements_
    - allow us to define a computation by creating and assigning values to variables, controlling execution flow, or causing side-effects
  - _arrays_
    - allow us to work with multiple values of the same type
  - _static methods_
    - allow us to encapsulate and reuse code and to develop programs as a set of independent modules
  - _strings_
    - sequence of chars
  - _input/output_
    - sets up communication between programs and the outside world
  - _data abstraction_
    - extends encapsulation and reuse to allow us to define non-primitive data types, thus supporting object-oriented programming
- To invoke a Java program, it is first compiled using the `javac` command and then ran using the `java` command
- The `javac` command creates a lower-level version of the program in Java bytecode

## Primitive Data Types and Expression

- A data type is a set of values and a set of operations on those values
- Four primitive types that form the basis of Java:
  - _integers_ `int` (with arithmetic operations)
  - _real numbers_ `double` (with arithmetic operations)
  - _booleans_ `boolean` set of values { true, false } with logical operations
  - _characters_ `char` the alphanumeric characters and symbols that are typed
- A Java program manipulates variables that are named with identifiers
- Each variable is associated with a data type and stores one of the permissible data-type values

### Expressions

- Typical expressions are infix: a literal (or an expression), followed by an operator, followed by another literal (or another expression)

### Type Conversion

- Numbers are automatically promoted to a more inclusive type if no information is lost

### Comparisons

- Comparison operators are known as mixed-type operators because their value is `boolean`, not the type of values being compared

### Statements

- A Java program is composed of statements, which define the computation by creating and manipulating variables, assigning data-type values to them and controlling the flow of execution
- Statements:
  - _declarations_ create variables
  - _assignments_ associate a data-type value with a variable
  - _conditionals_ provide for a simple change in the flow of execution
  - _loops_ provide for a more profound change in the flow of execution, by executing the statements in a block as long as a given condition is true
  - _calls_ and _returns_ relate to static methods, which provide another way to change the flow of execution and to organize code

## Arrays

- An array stores a sequence of values that are all of the same type

## Static Methods

- Every Java program (in this book) is either a data-type definition or a library of static methods
- Static methods are called functions in many programming languages

## APIs

- A critical component of modular programming is documentation that explains the operation of library methods that are intended for use by others
- These library methods will be consistently decribed (in this book) in application programming interfaces (APIs)

## Strings

- A string is a sequenc of characters (char values)
- A literal string is a sequence of characters within double quotes, such as "Hello, world"
- Strings are not primitive

## Input and Output

- The primary purpose of Java standard libraries for input, output, and drawing is to support a simple model to interact with the outside world

## Binary Search

- This algorithm will be used for learning/applying the concepts contained in the book
